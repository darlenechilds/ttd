# ttd
Transient tracer distributions (ttd) are calculated using the IG model and a timeseries (2015-2015) of tracer measurements (sulfur hexafluoride, SF6, chlorofluorocarbon 12, CFC12) in the Labrador Sea.  Output includes, water mass ages, ventilation rates, anthropogenic carbon uptake, rate of oxygen consumption/supplied using apparent oxygen utilization rate.
